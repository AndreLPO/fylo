## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to build a responsive WebSite with SASS (SCSS), using mixins.

```sass
@mixin mobile {
  @media (min-width: $screen-mobile) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin desktop {
  @media (min-width: $screen-desktop) {
    @content;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'll keeping learning React.JS with SASS and pratcting with Frontend Mentor.

### Useful resources

- [Medium Article about MIXINS](https://medium.com/codeartisan/breakpoints-and-media-queries-in-scss-46e8f551e2f2) - This helped me with mixin. I really liked mixins and breakpoints and will use it going forward.
